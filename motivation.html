                <h2 class="motih2">What are metaheuristics?</h2>
                <p class=motitext>"Metaheuristics is a rather unfortunate term often used to describe a major subfield,
                    indeed
                    the primary subfield, of stochastic optimization. Stochastic optimization is the general class of
                    algorithms and techniques which employ some degree of randomness to find optimal (or as optimal
                    as possible) solutions to hard problems. Metaheuristics are the most general of these kinds of
                    algorithms, and are applied to a very wide range of problems.</p>
                <p class=motitext>Metaheuristics are applied to <em>I know it when I see it </em> problems. They’re
                    algorithms used to find
                    answers to problems when you have very little to help you: you don’t know beforehand what the
                    optimal solution looks like, you don’t know how to go about finding it in a principled way, you
                    have very little heuristic information to go on, and brute-force search is out of the question
                    because
                    the space is too large. But if you’re given a candidate solution to your problem, you can test it
                    and
                    assess how good it is. That is, you know a good one when you see it." (Luke, 2013)</p>

                    This application introduces various metaheuristics (taxonomy on the right) by presenting the
                    underlying intuition as well as the algorithms.
                    In addition, exercises for implementing the metaheuristics yourself can be downloaded for each
                    specific algorithm. <strong>Enjoy!</strong>
