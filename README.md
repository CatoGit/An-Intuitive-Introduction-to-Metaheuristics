# An Intuitive Introduction to Metaheuristics

"An Intuitive Introduction to Metaheuristics" is an interactive instructional course that is available as
a web-based multimedia application. It aims at undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral students as
well as teachers that study or teach computer science. It is especially suitable for those students that
already have some experience with implementing algorithms but are new to the field of metaheuristics
and optimization. The application's goal is to provide an intuitive understanding of the most important
metaheuristic algorithms. It is also suitable for professors and teachers who are looking for new ways
to teach their students complex concepts.

This web application was created as part of my coursework at University of Stirling.
